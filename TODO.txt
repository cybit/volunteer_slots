Rough Idea:

Google spreadsheet as frontend and database
- Maybe later data collection in database
- Maybe later frontend for people to log in and change their own stuff
  - Slots
  - Absentee (will remove all entries of the person on that day)
    - will lead to an alarm to a dedicated number of persons.
  - Sign-in on slots
  - Warning if sign-in for slots has not been done
  - no sign in before start leads to general alarm
  - people can take over and push over slots from/to other people
  - there needs to be a history on all changes.
  - People can not take on multiple slots during the same time
- Maybe later a graphical frontend to create the schedule and manage things
- Maybe later a connection to discord to ping people
- Maybe later a  bot in discord that accepts sign-ins from people
- Maybe later a cached connection to pretalx to get the current schedule
  - will need to keep special tags on certain talks to mark them differently from the regular type

- If the times are updated automatically we will need to have a =/- setup to move start/end of timeslots.
- Slots can have different types (currently expressed by colors)

Get spreadsheet from google
Read tabs in spreadsheet and parse:
"Volunteers" - To get names to do calculations on
"Schedule" to get the schedule with timetables
"days" to get the different slots based on a certain day.

Calculations:
- calculate number of slots (per type) that don't have an entry  per day
- calculate the duration of a slot
- calcluate the number of slots a person has taken on
- calculate the minutes (hour:minute format) a person has assigned themselves
- compare minutes/slots to a personal goal each person can have set.
